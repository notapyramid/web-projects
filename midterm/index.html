    <p>"If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It becomes thus vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State." -"The mind of Adolf Hitler" report  </p>
    <p>In order to control, we need to control the speech of the people, and what speech is ok to read. Help us by voting for our politicians that support mandatory digital id you need to use for everything, from searching the web, to getting healthcare, to getting passports. </p></body>
