sorry if internal styling is a bit forced (i have internal stying when i could have added a line to a css class and get done with it).

also, disclaimer: the text after the peak stratagies on the about page is all generated by gemini. lmao it cooked so hard i did not even give it anything to base it off of.

also, yes i do know that the favicon is not named favicon.svg, and well, is a svg, and is not in the home direcotry. it is much cleaner to have it in a folder, much better looking to have it a vector, people with anciant browsers do not need to see it i dont care

we also be naming all the classes and files abc instead of a descriptive title... i am a menace
